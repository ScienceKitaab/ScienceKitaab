    <h2><u>EXPERIMENT 4</u>:REACTION OF ACIDS WITH METAL OXIDES</h2><br>
    <p><strong>AIM:</strong>To carry out the reaction of acids with metal oxides.</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</strong> Beaker/test tube, Glass rod, copper 
        oxide and Dilute Hydrochloric acid.
        </p>
            <br>
           
    <p><strong> PROCEDURE:</strong><br>
        • Take little amount of black copper oxide in a beaker/test tube.<br>
        • Add about 10 mL of Dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
        • With the help of a glass rod stir the solution gently.<br>
        • As the reaction is happening observe the beaker/test tube.

        </p><br>
        
    <p><strong> OBSERVATION: </strong><br>
        • When a mixture of copper oxide and Dilute HCl is mixed, 
suspended black particles of copper oxide can be seen in the 
colorless solution of dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
• The black particles slowly dissolve as the reaction proceeds.<br>
• Due to the formation of a salt i.e., copper (II) chloride (cupric 
chloride), the solution becomes bluish green.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><strong>INFERENCE:</strong><br>
                                • Formation of copper (II) chloride (cupric chloride) is the result of 
the reaction between copper oxide and dilute hydrochloric acid.<br>
• It is a salt of copper and forms bluish green solution.<br>
• The reaction is:<br>
CuO (s) + 2HCl (aq) → CuCl2 (aq) + H2O (l)<br>
• The general reaction between metal oxides and acids is <br>
Metal oxide + Acid → Salt + Water</p>
                                                    <br>
        <p><strong>PRECAUTIONS:</strong> <br> 
            • Care must be taken while handling the acid and base solutions.<br>
            • All the setup must be properly done.<br>
            •  Safety gloves should be used.<br>
            • Tasting or touching the solution should not be done.
            
            </p> <br>

            <p><strong> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong><br>
                Other metal oxides like calcium oxide (CaO) or quick lime and 
                magnesium oxide (MgO) also react in a similar way with acids.<br>
                • CaO (s) + 2HCl (aq)  → CaCl2 (aq) + H2O (l)
        </p>
                                <br>

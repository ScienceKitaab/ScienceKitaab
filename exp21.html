    <h2><u>EXPERIMENT 1</u>: Reaction of Zinc with Dilute Sulphuric acid</h2><br>
    <p><strong>AIM:</strong> To carry the reaction of zinc with Dilute Sulphuric acid and classify 
        it as a physical or chemical change.</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</strong> Boiling test tube/beaker/ beaker, Dilute Sulphuric 
        acid, Zinc Dust, Spatula, Match box, dropper.
        </p>
            <br>
           
    <p><strong> PROCEDURE:</strong><br>
        • Add few drops of Dilute Sulphuric acid using a dropper in a boiling test 
        tube/beaker/beaker.<br>
        • Using a spatula add some zinc dust into the boiling tube/beaker.<br>
        • In this reaction you will observe that zinc reacts with acid and releases 
        a gas.<br>
        • Take the test tube/beaker and light a matchstick and introduce it into 
        the gas near the mouth of the test tube/beaker.
        </p><br>
        
    <p><strong> OBSERVATION:</strong><br>
        • We observe that the matchstick burns with a pop sound when brought 
near the open end of the test tube/beaker.<br>
•The pop sound is a clear indication that the gas evolved is hydrogen.<br>
• When a metal reacts with an acid Hydrogen gas is released.<br>
• If we take the red and blue litmus paper and hold it over the mouth of 
the test tube/beaker when the gas is released there will no change in 
the color of the papers.</p>
                            <br>
     <p><strong>INFERENCE: </strong> <br> 
        • In this reaction zinc reacts with Dilute Sulphuric acid to form an 
        aqueous solution of zinc sulphate and Hydrogen gas evolves.<br>
        •  Zn(s) + H2SO4(aq) → ZnSO4(aq) + H2(g)↑<br>
        •  The chemical composition is different from the reactants. Hence, it is 
        a chemical change.
        
        </p> <br>
        <p><strong>PRECAUTIONS:</strong> <br> 
            •   Always wear safety gloves while handling chemicals.<br>
            •  Acids and chemicals must be handled carefully under the 
            assistance of a teacher.<br>
            •   Keep the mouth of the test tube/beaker away from your face.

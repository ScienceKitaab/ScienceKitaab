    <h2><u>EXPERIMENT 4</u>: ELECTROLYTIC DECOMPOSITION REACTION 
        (ELECTROLYSIS)</h2><br>
    <p><strong>AIM:</strong> Observation of the electrolysis of water and determining the gases 
        liberated in the process.</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</strong> Mini Hoffman apparatus (Electrolysis unit, Electrical wire with alligator 
        clips (2 wires), Gas collection tubes), 6-Volt or 9-Volt battery, Salt or 
        NaOH solution), Water, stirring rod, Matches or candle.
        </p><br>
        <p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> <br>
            Electrolysis of water if the process through which water is decomposed 
            into Hydrogen and Oxygen gas, when electric current is passed through 
            it. For the electrolyte i.e., we add salt (highly polar) or NaOH solution 
            so that the ions of salt or NaOH pull the water molecules apart into 
            ions. Water molecule is decomposed into H+ and OH- ions. The ions 
            move to the oppositely charged electrodes and liberated as gases at 
            the electrodes. Bubbles of Hydrogen gas(H2) is formed at the cathode 
            and the Bubbles of oxygen (O2) form at the anode. The amount of 
            hydrogen gas produced is twice that of oxygen gas.
            The reaction is <br>
            2H2O (l) --> 2H2(g) + O2(g) </p>
            <br>
    <p><strong> PROCEDURE:</strong> <br>
        The apparatus consists of two electrodes (Graphite or Platinum) on 
which the discharge tube or test tube is placed upside down after filling 
the apparatus with electrolyte. To the water the alligator clips of wire 
are connected to a 6V battery one to the positive and the other 
negative terminal (Electrodes behave as Anode and Cathode 
respectively) and then the current is sent through the water. After 
some time, H+ and OH- ions move to the electrodes which are 
oppositely charged. The gases collected during the process can be 
tested with a glowing splint and the observations are recorded
        .</p>
                <br>
    <p><strong>OBSERVATION AND INFERENCE:</strong>  <br>
        • In one glass tube the amount of gas collected is twice the amount in 
        the other glass tube.<br>
        • When a glowing splint is kept near the tube which collected twice the 
        amount of gas, Ignition and an audible pop can be observed. 
        Indicating the presence of Hydrogen<br>
        • The glowing splint kept near the other tube will flame up more 
        indicating the presence of Oxygen.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><strong>CHEMICAL REACTION:</strong> <br>
                                • Anode (+ve electrode): 2H2O(l) --> O2 (g) + 4H+(aq)<br>
                                • Cathode (-ve electrode): 2H+(aq) + 2e ---> H2(g)<br>
                                • Overall reaction: 2H2O (l) --> 2H2(g) + O2(g) </p><br>
     <p><strong>PRECAUTIONS: </strong> <br> 
        • Be careful of explosive hydrogen and oxygen mixtures. <br>
        • It is a good idea to burn the gases off to prevent a dangerous mixture.<br>
        • Always wear goggles and safety gloves while performing the 
        experiment.<br>
        • Should be done under the guidance of a teacher.</p> <br>
    
    <p><strong> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong><br>
        • This electrolysis can be done without the Hoffman Apparatus using 
        beaker, rubber stopper and graphite rods as electrodes but care and 
        safety precautions must be taken accordingly. <br>
        • Another example of Electrolytic decomposition is <br>
        • Decomposition of sodium chloride: On passing electricity through 
        molten sodium chloride, it decomposes into sodium and chlorine.<br>
        • 2NaCl --electricity--> 2Na + Cl2 </p>

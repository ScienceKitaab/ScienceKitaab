    <h2><u>EXPERIMENT 6</u>:   ENDOTHERMIC SOLID-SOLID REACTION.</h2><br>
    <p><strong>AIM:</strong>  In this experiment we observe a reaction between solid hydrated 
        Barium hydroxide and Solid Ammonium chloride and classify the type 
        of reaction.</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>APPARATUS:</strong>  Beakers, stirring rod, Wooden platform or watch glass, Thermometer 
        (Reading to -30°C) 
        </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>CHEMICALS REQUIRED:</strong> Barium Hydroxide-8-water [Ba (OH)2.8H2O(s)], 
                Ammonium Chloride [NH4Cl (s)]. 
                </p>
                    <br>
    <p><strong> PROCEDURE:</strong><br>
        • Stand the beaker on a watch glass or on the wooden platform 
containing a few drops of water, so that the base of the beaker is 
touching the water.<br>
•  Note the room temperature.<br>
•  Mix the two solids in the beaker and stir it. The mixture becomes 
slushy as a liquid is formed, together with a white suspension.
<br>• The presence of ammonia can be detected by smell, and confirmed by 
blowing fumes from the hydrochloric acid bottle across the beaker’s 
mouth.<br>
•  Observe the drop in temperature, which is confirmed by the fact that 
the beaker freezes to the watch glass or the wooden platform.<br>
•  Ba(OH)2.8H2O(s) + 2NH4Cl(s) → 2NH3(g) + 10H2O(l) + BaCl2(s)<br>
        </p><br>
        
    <p><strong> INFERENCE:</strong><br>
        When the energy is gained by the chemicals the surroundings lose 
        energy leading to a decrease in the temperature. Hence, this reaction 
        can be classified as an endothermic reaction.</p>
                            <br>
     <p><strong>PRECAUTIONS: </strong> <br> 
        • Wear eye protection (goggles) throughout the experiment.<br>
        •  The room must be well ventilated.<br>
        • Avoid lumps as far as possible when weighing out the required amount 
of Barium hydroxide and Ammonium chloride.<br>
         •  Don’t inhale Ammonia gas directly.<br>
        </p> <br>
    
    <p><strong> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong><br>
        •  <u>EXOTHERMIC REACTIONS</u>: The reactions or processes that release 
energy (in form of heat or light). The energy is released because the 
total energy of the reactants is greater than the total products of the 
products. <br>
•  <u>Example</u>: A strong acid will dissociate quickly and release heat in 
presence of water.<br>
• <u>ENDOTHERMIC REACTIONS</u> : These require external energy, usually in 
form of heat for the reaction to proceed. These draw heat from the 
surroundings leading for their environments to cool down.<br>
• <u>Example</u> : Melting of ice cube.

    <h2><u>EXPERIMENT 3</u>:REACTION BETWEEN ACIDS AND BASES.</h2><br>
    <p><strong>AIM:</strong>To carry out the reaction between acid and a base.</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</strong> Test tube/beaker, dropper, Phenolphthalein indicator, Solution 
        of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and Dilute Hydrochloric acid (Dil. 
        HCl)
        </p>
            <br>
           
    <p><strong> PROCEDURE:</strong><br>
        • Take about 2 mL solution of NaOH solution (Sodium Hydroxide) 
in a test tube/beaker.<br>
• Add a drop of phenolphthalein indicator to it and observe the 
color.<br>
• Add Dil. HCl dropwise with the help of a dropper and stir the 
solution constantly until the color disappears.<br>
• Add a few drops of NaOH solution and observe the change.
        </p><br>
        
    <p><strong> OBSERVATION: </strong><br>
        • Pink color solution is observed when a drop of phenolphthalein 
        is added to the solution of NaOH.<br>
        • The pink color fades on adding HCl. <br>
        • This is due to reaction between HCl and NaOH.<br>
        • The solution becomes colorless when NaOH has reacted 
        completely with HCl.<br>
        • The solution turns pink again on addition of NaOH.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><strong>INFERENCE:</strong><br>
                                •  When Dilute HCl is added to NaOH solution, there is reaction 
                                between them. <br>
                                •  When the required amount of the acid i.e., Dilute HCl is added, 
                                the basic properties and the acidic properties of NaOH and Dil. 
                                HCl disappear respectively. <br>
                                •  This process is called Neutralization and results in the formation 
                                of Salt and water.<br>
                                • The reaction between HCl and NaOH forms NaCl (Sodium 
                                chloride) and water.<br>
                                • HCl (aq) + NaOH (aq)  →  NaCl (aq) + H2O (l) <br>
                                • In general, the reaction between an acid and a base can be 
                                 written as:<br>
                                 • Acid + Base  →  Salt + Water</p>
                                                    <br>
        <p><strong>PRECAUTIONS:</strong> <br> 
            • Care must be taken while handling the acid and base solutions. <br>
            • All the setup must be properly done. <br>
            • Safety gloves should be used. <br>
            • Tasting or touching the solution should not be done.
            </p> <br>

            <p><strong> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong><br>
                •  Another example of neutralization reaction is:<br>
                •  Sulphuric acid and Potassium Hydroxide react to form 
                potassium sulphate and water.<br>
                •  H2SO4(aq) + 2KOH (aq) → K2SO4(aq) + 2H2O (l)
        </p>

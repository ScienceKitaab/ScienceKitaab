    <h2><u>EXPERIMENT 1</u>: Burning of Magnesium ribbon in air.</h2><br>
    <p><strong>AIM:</strong> To carry out the reaction of “Burning Magnesium ribbon in air” 
        and classifying it as a physical or chemical change.</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</strong>  Magnesium ribbon, Red Litmus paper, A pair of 
            Tongs, Bunsen Burner, Watch glass.</p>
            <br>
    <p><strong> PROCEDURE:</strong>  Cut a piece of Magnesium ribbon and clean the ribbon using sand 
        paper. Hold the ribbon using a pair of Tongs. Flame this ribbon in the 
        Bunsen burner, Collect the burnt ash in watch glass and label it as 
        Magnesium Oxide.This is a chemical reaction as oxygen and magnesium come together to 
        form Magnesium oxide.
         2 Mg (s) + O2 (g) 2 MgO (s)
        Now take the red litmus paper and moisten it with distilled water. 
        Place the moist red litmus paper over the watch glass so that it is in 
        contact with Magnesium oxide. You can see that the red litmus turns 
        blue.</p>
                <br>
    <p><strong> INFERENCE:</strong>  From the above procedure we can infer that magnesium oxide is basic in nature. 
        This reaction shows a chemical change as the reactants oxygen and magnesium 
        combine together to form a new substance i.e Magnesium Oxide. 
        The formed magnesium oxide has different chemical composition which is 
        different from both Magnesium and oxygen.</p>
                            <br>
     <p><strong>PRECAUTIONS: </strong> <br> 
        1. This Activity needs the teacher’s assistance and should be done under 
guidance.<br>
2. Make sure you hold the magnesium ribbon securely with a pair of tongs 
while burning it. <br>
3. It is better to use sunglasses or suitable eyeglasses to protect eyes from 
the bright light produced by burning magnesium (Contains UV light which 
can damage the retina of the eyes).</p> <br>
    
    <p><strong> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong><br>
        1. Magnesium is an Alkaline earth metal (Group 2, Atomic No: 12, 
        Symbol: Mg). It is a silvery white metal. It is highly inflammable 
        metal and easy to ignite in powdered form or thin strips.
        <br>2. Magnesium Oxide (MgO) is an inorganic compound that occurs in 
        nature as mineral periclase (A colorless mineral occurring chiefly 
        in marble and limestone). In aqueous media combine quickly with 
        water to form Magnesium hydroxide</p>

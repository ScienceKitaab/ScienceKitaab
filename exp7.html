    <h2><u>EXPERIMENT 7</u>: DISPLACEMENT REACTION.</h2><br>
    <p><strong>AIM:</strong> In this experiment we observe a reaction between iron and 
        copper sulphate solution and classify it.</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</strong> Copper sulphate solution, Iron nails, boiling test tubes, Stands with 
        clamp and thread. 
        </p>
            <br>
    <p><strong> PROCEDURE:</strong><br>
        • Take two stands with clamps and fix one test tube in each stand.<br>
        • Tie one iron nail with a piece of thread and hang it in one of the test 
tubes and tie the other end of the thread to the stand.<br>
        • Take copper sulphate solution in a beaker and pour it into the both test 
tubes.<br>
        • Keep the apparatuses undisturbed for a day.<br>
        • After one day, remove the iron nail immersed in the solution and 
compare it with the other iron nail which wasn’t immersed in the 
copper sulphate solution.
        </p><br>
        <p><strong> OBSERVATION:</strong><br>
            • Iron nail which was dipped in the copper sulphate solution shows a 
brown coating compared to the greyish color of the other nail.<br>
• The color of the copper sulphate solution in the test tube in which the 
nail has been dipped changes from blue to green and a bit colorless.<br>
• The color of the copper sulphate solution in which nail wasn’t dipped 
stays the same color.

           
            </p>
                <br>
    <p><strong> INFERENCE:</strong><br>
        • The brown coating indicates that the copper is deposited on the iron 
nail by displacing iron.<br>
• The change of colour from blue to green of the solution indicates a 
chemical change in which Copper has been displaced by iron from the 
copper sulphate solution and a new compound Ferrous sulphate 
(FeSO4) is formed.<br>
• CuSO4 (aq) + Fe (s) → FeSO4 + Cu (s)<br>
• Since there is displacement of one chemical with another this reaction 
can be classified as a displacement reaction</p>
                            <br>
     <p><strong>PRECAUTIONS: </strong> <br> 
        • Try to avoid touching the copper sulphate solution and the nail dipped 
        in the solution.<br>
        • It is advised to wear gloves while using materials containing copper 
        sulphate.
        
        </p> <br>
    
    <p><strong> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong><br>
        • The chemical reaction in which a more reactive element displaces 
a less reactive element from its compound is known as a 
displacement reaction.<br>
•  Both metals and non-metals take part in the displacement 
reactions.<br>
•  Other examples of displacement reactions are<br>
•  Zn (s) + CuSO4 (aq) → ZnSO4 (aq) + Cu (s)<br>
•  Pb (s) + CuCl2 (aq) → PbCl2 (aq) + Cu (s)</p>

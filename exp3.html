    <h2><u>EXPERIMENT 3</u>:DECOMPOSITION REACTION.</h2><br>
    <p><strong>AIM:</strong> Finding the action of heat on Ferrous Sulphate crystals and 
        further classifying the reaction.</p><br>
    <p><strong>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</strong> Ferrous Sulphate crystals, Boiling tubes, Test 
        tube holder and a spatula, Bunsen burner.</p>
            <br>
    <p><strong> PROCEDURE:</strong>  
        • Using a spatula and transfer a slight quantity of Ferrous sulphate 
        crystals into a dry boiling tube.<br>
        • Note the light green colour of the ferrous sulphate crystals.<br>
        • Hold the boiling test tube with the holder and heat it over Bunsen 
        burners Flame for a large time.<br>
        • While heating Note the odour by smelling the fumes coming out of 
        the boiling tube.<br>
        • Finally transfer the heated substance in the test tube into a watch 
        glass.</p>

        <p><strong> OBSERVATION:</strong> The crystal’s colour changes from light green to white. Further heating 
            changes the white substance to dark brown solid. </p>
                                <br>

        
                <br>
    <p><strong> INFERENCE:</strong> 
        •  The colour change is due to the formation of anhydrous Ferrous 
        sulphate which is produced when the Ferrous sulphate crystals are 
        heated. <br>
        • FeSO4.7H2O  --Heat-->  FeSO4 + 7H2O<br>
        •  Ferrous sulphate becomes Anhydrous due to the loss of water 
        molecules on heating the crystals. <br>
        •  Then it decomposes to form a dark brown solid i.e., Ferric oxide and 
        Sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide which are emitted out of the test 
        tube as gases.<br>
         2FeSO4(s) --Heat--> Fe2O3 (s) + SO2(g) +SO3(g) <br>
 
         • From the observation, we can understand that this is a decomposition 
        reaction because the single reactant, Anhydrous Ferrous sulphate is 
        breaking down to give much simple products like Ferric oxide, Sulphur 
        dioxide and Sulphur trioxide.</p>
                            <br>
     <p><strong>PRECAUTIONS: </strong> <br> 
        • While heating a test tube make sure to always us a test tube holder.<br>
        • Inhalation of the gases i.e., SO3 and SO2 must be avoided as difficulty 
        in breathing may arise.</p> <br>
    
    <p><strong> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong><br>
        Another example is decomposition of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) to 
        Calcium Oxide and Carbon dioxide on heating. This is an important 
        reaction used in various industries like in the manufacture of cement. 
        As this reaction occurs through heating it is called Thermal 
        Decomposition.<br> 
        CaCO3 (s) --Heat--> CaO(s) + CO2 (g)<br>

    <h2><u>EXPERIMENT 5</u>:  PHOTO DECOMPOSITION REACTION (PHOTOLYSIS) .</h2><br>
    <p><strong>AIM:</strong>  To carry out the chemical reaction occurring under the influence 
        of light.</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</strong>  Silver Chloride, China dish, Light source (sunlight or adjustable white 
        light source), Any object (Like small steel ring)
        </p>
            <br>
    <p><strong> PROCEDURE:</strong><br>Take about 2gm of Silver chloride in a china dish and place the object 
        on it. Keep the china dish under sunlight or the light source for some 
        time and then removed from under the source.
        </p><br>
        <p><strong> OBSERVATION:</strong><br>The colour of the powder changes from white to a mettalic grey colour. 
            When we remove the object on the powder the area under the object 
            is still white in colour where as the surface exposed to the light is 
            visibly dark.
            <br> 2AgCl --light--> 2 Ag (s) + Cl2(g) 
            </p>
                <br>
    <p><strong> INFERENCE:</strong><br>
        • The light energy has caused decomposition of Silver chloride into 
        Silver and Chlorine gas.<br> 
        • The part under the object has not been exposed to air hence the 
        powder under it remained white and didn’t undergo decomposition. <br>
        • This is a photo decomposition reaction as it occurred under the light 
        energy.<br>
        • Decomposition reactions require energy either in the form of heat, 
        light or electricity for the brealing down of the reactants.<br>
        • Thus, Decomposition reactions are endothermic reactions.</p>
                            <br>
     <p><strong>PRECAUTIONS: </strong> <br> 
        • Safety precautions should be followed in laboratory.<br>
        • Wear glasses or goggles to avoid direct exposure to the light source.<br>
        • The china dish should get fully exposed to the light.<br>
        </p> <br>
    
    <p><strong> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong><br>
        • Silver Bromide also behaves in the same way<br>
        • 2AgBr --light--> 2Ag (s) + Br2(g)<br>
        • These reactions are used in black and white Photography.<br>
        • Formation of Silver Chloride:It is an example of Double 
        decomposition reaction. When dilute solutions of Sodium chloride 
        (NaCl) and Silver Nitrate are mixed then Silver Chloride (AgCl) is 
        formed.<br>
        • Silver chloride is an insoluble salt and would be precipitated<br>
        • NaCl (aq) + AgNO3  --light--> AgCl (s) + NaNO3(aq)<br>
        • This precipitated AgCl is filtered and kept on filter paper dried and 
        then the above experiment is conducted.</p>

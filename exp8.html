    <h2><u>EXPERIMENT 8</u>: DOUBLE DISPLACEMENT REACTION</h2><br>
    <p><strong>AIM:</strong> Study the reaction between sodium sulphate and barium chloride and 
        classify the type of the reaction.</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</strong> Boiling test tubes, Solution of Sodium sulphate and solution of barium 
        chloride.
        </p>
            <br>
           
    <p><strong> PROCEDURE:</strong><br>
        •  Take a small quantity of sodium sulphate solution in a test tube and 
barium chloride in another test tube.<br>
•  Pour the barium chloride into the test tube containing Sodium 
Sulphate solution.
        </p><br>
        
    <p><strong> OBSERVATION:</strong><br>
        • A white precipitate is formed in the test tube. After 10 minutes the 
precipitate settles to the bottom of the test tube. <br>
• When we add a few drops of dilute HCl to the white precipitate and 
shake the test tube well, we observe that it is insoluble in dilute HCl.</p>
                            <br>
     <p><strong>INFERENCE: </strong> <br> 
        • The formation of white precipitate and its insolubility when dilute HCl 
        is added to it confirms the presence of Sulphate ions in the solution 
        and also that it is Barium Sulphate.<br>
        • A chemical reaction occurs between Sodium sulphate and Barium 
        chloride to form Barium sulphate and sodium Chloride.<br>
        • Na2SO4 (aq)+ BaCl2 (aq) → 
         BaSO4 (s) + 2NaCl (aq)<br>
         • This is a double displacement reaction in which sulphate ions are 
        displaced by chloride ions and chloride ions are displaced by sulphate 
        ions.
        </p> <br>
    
    <p><strong> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong><br>
        • Double displacement reactions are those reactions in which one 
component each of the reacting molecules is exchanged to form new 
products. During this reaction, the cations and anions of two different 
compounds switch places to form two different compounds.<br>
•  The general equation representing it is<br>
•   AB+CD → AD+CB<br>
  •  Other examples of double displacement reactions are<br>
  • Na2S (aq) + CuSO4(aq) → CuS (s) + Na2SO4 (aq)

    <h2><u>EXPERIMENT 2 :</u>COMBINATION REACTION</h2><br>
    <p><strong>AIM:</strong>To carry out the reaction of between quick lime (Calcium oxide, 
        CaO) and water to classify it as a combination reaction.</p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>MATERIALS REQUIRED:</strong> Calcium oxide, Watch glass, Jet Tube, Beaker, 
        Test tube and distilled water.</p>
            <br>
    <p><strong> PROCEDURE:</strong>
        • Take a small amount of Calcium Oxide (Quick lime) using a spatula 
        and to a beaker.<br>
        • Slowly add distilled water into the beaker. Pour enough water so 
        that the quick lime remains submerged in the water.<br>
        • Here quick lime reacts with water and forms a suspension of slaked 
        lime in water.<br>
        • CaO(s) + H2O(l) Ca(OH)2 + Heat <br>
        (Quick lime) (Slaked Lime)<br>
        • This reaction is exothermic in nature as it releases thermal energy in 
        the process.<br>
        • Now keep the beaker undisturbed for some time.<br>
        • We can see that a clear solution appears as the suspension of slaked 
        lime settles down.<br>
        • This clear solution is known as lime water.<br>
        • To confirm the presence of calcium hydroxide in lime water, add a 
few drops of clear solution i.e., lime water into a boiling tube.<br>
• Close the mouth of the boiling with a cork and insert a glass tube 
into it.<br>
• Then blow the exhaled air into the lime water through this glass 
tube.<br>
• On blowing, carbon dioxide contained in the exhaled air turns lime 
water milky.<br>
    </p>
                <br>
    <p><strong> INFERENCE:</strong> 
        • This is a combination reaction as the two reactants- quick lime and 
        water react to form a single product, calcium hydroxide i.e., slaked 
        lime.<br>
        • Exhaled air contains CO2 which turns lime water milky.</p>
                            <br>
     <p><strong>PRECAUTIONS: </strong> <br> 
        •  Ensure quick lime does not come in contact with moist skin as it can 
        hurt the skin.<br>
        •  Always pour water into a small quantity of quick lime taken in a 
        beaker.<br>
        •  Never put quick lime directly into the water as it may cause water to 
        splash out.<br>
        •  Avoid inhalation of quick lime as it may cause coughing, sneezing 
        etc,</p> <br>
    
    <p><strong> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong><br>
        A solution of slaked lime is used for whitewashing walls. Calcium 
        hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin layer 
        of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is formed after two 
        to three days of whitewashing and gives A shiny finish to the walls. It is 
        interesting to note that the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO3.
        <br>Ca(OH)2 (aq) + CO2(g) CaCO3 (s) + H2O(l)
